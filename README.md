### BluetoothControl

##### Abstract:
BluetoothControl is a C program which I sort in the category »GtkIndicatorApp«. This group of projects contains applications written in C, which are working as helpers controlled via a trayicon-menu. I will publish more GtkIndicatorApp's soon. <br />
The BluetoothControl is a tool which should save the power of your notebook/tablet by simply enable or disable a specific bluetooth device via a trayicon-menu. <br />
The trayicon also have a dynamic view, this means it displays the current state of the bluetooth device. <br />
<span style='color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)'><i>!ATTENTION! This feature is fake, the icon only changes when you use the menu, it is not reading the real on-state of the hci module!</i></span><br />
This application is based on GTK and LibAppIndicator.
